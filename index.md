## About Me

Hello there! I am pursuing MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL. I will be taking courses related to Graphical Models, Bayesian Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Data Mining, Robotics. I look forward to leverage machine learning techniques to tackle real-world problems, as well as contribute in the research and development industry.

Before that, I obtained my BSc with First Class Honours in Physics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). My study tracks were Theoretical Physics and Computational Physics. I had been an undergraduate research assistant for machine learning applications in Computational Condensed Matter Physics. I had contributed in implementations of numerical algorithms for processing and feature engineering of crystal structure data, developing deep learning architectures, and visualisation of modelling results. I also had a Statistics Minor with courses in Multivariate Analysis, Regression Analysis, Recommender Systems, Time Series.
